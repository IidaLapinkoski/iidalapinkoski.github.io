              As a 2D artist and animator, I’ve been honing my skills for the past year, immersing myself in the craft with enthusiasm and dedication. While I may be early in my professional journey, my passion drives me to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. Every project is an opportunity to explore new techniques, experiment with style, and bring stories to life visually.

              I thrive when I get to turn ideas into compelling visuals that resonate with players, whether it’s a character, an environment, or a short animation. My goal is to keep growing as an artist, pushing the boundaries of my creativity, and contributing work that is both imaginative and impactful. I approach every project with curiosity, persistence, and a genuine love for storytelling through art and 
              animation.

              When I'm not creating art, you can find me playing video games, baking, or diving into a good book. These experiences fuel my creativity and inspire my artistic vision.
